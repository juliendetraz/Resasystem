= Admin Panel Configuration

You can configure the admin panel using the initializer the generator created. 
You can find it at {{{config/initializers/typus.rb}}}.

== Admin Title

The {{{admin_title}}} is what is shown on the login page and as a header of the 
admin panel. When the generator is run the application will use the folder name 
of the Rails application.

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.admin_title = "Application Name"
end
}}}

== Admin Sub Title

The {{{admin_sub_title}}} is shown at the login page and at the admin panel 
footer.

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.admin_sub_title = "Developed by ..."
end
}}}

== Authentication

There are 3 authentication methods: //none//, //basic//, //advanced//. By 
default the application uses the basic one, which is an http authentication. To 
use the //advanced// method, you'll need to run the {{{typus:migration}}} 
generator as a users table is needed.

{{{
Typus.config.setup do |config|
  config.authentication = :none|:http_basic|:session
end
}}}

With the {{{advanced}}} authentication method you'll be able to use the role 
mechanism.

== Mailer Sender

Recover password is disabled by default. To enable it you should provide an 
email address which will be shown as the sender.

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.mailer_sender = "typus@application.com"
end
}}}

== Master Role

This is the value of the master role of the application. By default we use the 
role admin as the default value.

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.master_role = "admin"
end
}}}

== User Class Name

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.user_class_name = "TypusUser"
end
}}}

== User Fk

{{{
Typus.setup do |config|
  config.user_fk = "typus_user_id"
end
}}}
