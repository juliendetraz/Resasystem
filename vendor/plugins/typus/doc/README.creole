= Typus: Admin Panel for Ruby on Rails Applications

A few years ago I developed websites using [[http://movabletype.org/|Movable Type]], 
[[http://drupal.com/|Drupal]], [[http://textpattern.com/|TextPattern]] and 
[[http://b2evolution.net/|b2]], which later become [[http://wordpress.org/|Wordpress]]. 
I decided to stop using all those content management systems and 
started to develop web applications with [[http://rubyonrails.org/|Ruby on Rails]].

Inspired by the tools I used, and with a simple idea "Trusted users editing 
structured content", I started to develop a [[http://rubyonrails.org/|Rails]] 
application to manage the sites I was building. This was the first attempt to 
make a simple but powerful content management system. I adapted that application 
to many projects, but I decided to extract the core functionality as a plugin 
which is now known a **Typus**.
