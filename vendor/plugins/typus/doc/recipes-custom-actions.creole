= Custom Actions

You can overwrite and extend Admin::ResourcesController with your methods. 
Actions are defined in {{{config/typus/application.yml}}}:

{{{
Post:
  ...
  actions:
    index: custom_action
    edit: custom_action_for_an_item
}}}

Remember to define permissions on {{{config/typus/application_roles.yml}}} to 
have access to the new actions.

{{{
admin:
  Post: all

editor:
  Post: create, read, update, custom_action_for_an_item
}}}

Your controller will look like this ...

{{{
class Admin::PostsController < Admin::ResourcesController

  def custom_action
    ...
  end

  def custom_action_for_an_item
    ...
  end

end
}}}
