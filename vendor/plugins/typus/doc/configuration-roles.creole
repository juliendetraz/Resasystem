= Roles Configuration

Typus roles are stored on {{{yaml}}} files. The configuration is really easy. 
On the {{{config/typus}}} folder there are {{{yaml}}} files which end with 
{{{_roles.yml}}}. These files is where the setup is done.

You can add as many roles as you want and the access control allow you to give 
access to users from a role to the {{{CRUD}}} methods of a model and to custom 
actions you define per model.

{{{
admin:
  # Category has access to the default methods.
  Category: create, read, update, delete
  # Posts for example have a custom method called +rebuild+.
  Post: create, read, update, delete, rebuild
  # TypusUser has access to all methods.
  TypusUser: all

editor:
  # An editor will only have access to create and update.
  Category: create, update
  # An editor will only have access to read posts. This means index, 
  # search and show.
  Post: read
}}}

TIP: Remember you can use the shortcut {{{all}}} to allow user have access to 
**all** methods.
