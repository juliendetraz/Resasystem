= Does Typus Support Namespaced Models?

If you want to be able to use {{{delayed_job}}} you need to add the following 
two lines to your {{{config/routes.rb}}} file before 
{{{Typus::Routes.draw(map)}}}.

{{{
map.connect "admin/delayed/jobs/:action/:id(.:format)", :controller => "admin/delayed/jobs"
}}}

And then create and configure {{{config/typus/delayed_job.yml}}} and 
{{{config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml}}} as you do with your other models.

File {{{config/typus/delayed_job.yml}}}:

{{{
Delayed::Job:
  fields:
    list: ...
    form: ...
  search: ...
}}}

File {{{config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml}}}:

{{{
admin:
  Delayed::Job: all
}}}
