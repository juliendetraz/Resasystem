= User Interface Customization

You can customize the admin panel interface overwriting the default templates 
included with the plugin.

== Views

Add your own views to match your application requirements.

{{{
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/index.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/edit.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/show.html.erb
}}}

Need a custom view on the Articles listing? Drop the file {{{index.html.erb}}} 
on {{{app/views/admin/articles}}} and the default {{{index.html.erb}}} will be 
replaced for the articles resource.

Want to overwrite the show view for all resources of your application? Drop the 
file {{{index.html.erb}}} on {{{app/views/admin/resources}}} and the default 
{{{index.html.erb}}} template will be replaced for all resources.

== Partials

You can overwrite partials for all resources or by individual ones:

{{{
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_index.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_new.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_edit.html.erb
views/admin/<RESOURCE>|resources/_show.html.erb
}}}

You can also overwrite the sidebar of the dashboard:

{{{
views/admin/dashboard/_sidebar.html.erb
}}}

== Attribute Templates

It is possible to change the presentation for an attribute within the form. In 
the example below the {{{published_at}}} attribute is datetime attribute and 
will use the {{{_datetime.html.erb}}} template located on the templates folder 
{{{app/views/admin/templates}}}. The resource and the attribute name will be 
sent as local variables {{{resource}}} and {{{attribute}}}.

{{{
# app/views/admin/templates/_datetime.html.erb
<li><label><%= t(attribute.humanize) %></label>
  <%= calendar_date_select :item, attribute %>
</li>
}}}
