= Resource Configuration

Sometimes your need to manage some services, view log files or do any other 
task which is not related to a model.

Let's say for example you want to see the {{{memcached}}} status of your 
application and also want to be able to flush all the keys.

First of all we will create a controller:

{{{
class Admin::MemcachedController < Admin::ResourceController

  def index
    # Here we return the status of the service.
  end

  def flush_all
    # Here we flush all the keys and redirect to the index.
    redirect_to :back, :notice => _("Memcached has been flushed.")
  end

end
}}}

We will need some views for the new controller. We will create them on the 
application.

{{{
app/views/admin/memcached/index.html.erb
}}}

And finally we will add the permissions to {{{memcached}}} as we don't want 
editors to have access to the {{{flush}}} command.

{{{
# config/typus/application_roles.yml
admin:
  Memcached: index, flush_all

editor:
  Memcached: index
}}}
