= Installation

== Plugin Install

To install Typus as a plugin:

{{{
$ rails plugin install git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git
}}}

NOTE: To re-install the plugin use the {{{--force}}} option.

== Gem Install

To install **Typus** as a {{{gem}}}, edit the application {{{Gemfile}}} and add 
the following line.

{{{
gem "typus"
}}}

Install the gem using the bundler:

{{{
$ bundle install
}}}

== Running the Generator

Once the plugin or gem is installed you need to run a generator to copy 
**Typus** stylesheets, images and other required files to your application.

{{{
$ rails generate typus
}}}

By default **Typus** will use an http authentication but if you want to use a 
better authentication system you need to run a second generator.

{{{
$ rails generate typus:migration
$ rake db:migrate
}}}

This generator will create a new model, {{{AdminUser}}}, in your application, 
some settings which will be stored under {{{config/typus}}} folder and will also 
create a migration. You can see some options of this generator running the 
following command.

{{{
$ rails generate typus:migration -h
}}}

== Login into Typus

Start the application server, go to http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin and follow the 
instructions.
